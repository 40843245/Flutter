# project hierarchy in Flutter project (view in Android Studio)
## preface
When you create a new Flutter project in Android Studio, you will see it includes these folders:
+ `.dart_tool`
+ `.idea`
+ `build`
+ `test`
+ `lib`
+ all selected platforms when you create a flutter project.

Here, in this project I selected all platforms -- `Android`,`IOS`,`macOS`,`Linux`,`web` and `Windows`.

So my project hierarchy looks like the following figure.
